Questions:
Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.

Answer:

Data Types:

Data Type is the classification of data into its designated type.
for exapmle we have a number one which is classified as integer data type.

We have two types data types:
1)Premitive Data Types
2)Non-Premitive Data Types

Premitive Data Types:

These data types are inbuilt data types which are given directly by the programming language.
These data types only take a single input.

integer,string,float,boolean,charecter are considered as Premitive Data types
exapmle:
var a = 1 //integer
var a = "string" // string
var a = 0.1 //float
var a = False // boolean
var a = 'c' // charecter

Non-Premitive Data Types:

These data types are user defined data types. They can take myltiple inputs.
There Two types of Non-Premitive Data Types:
1)Linear Data Types
2)Non-Linear Data Types

Linear Data Types:
In this data type elements are stored in a sequential order.

array, stack, queue, linkedlist are considered as Linear Data Types.
exapmle:
let a = [1,2,3]

Non-Linear Data Types:
In this data type elements are not stored in a sequential order.

trees, graphs, hashtables are considered as Non-Linear Data Types.
